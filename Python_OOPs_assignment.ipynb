        "1:- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**, which are instances of **classes**. OOP focuses on structuring code to model real-world entities and their interactions. It emphasizes code organization, reusability, and abstraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the core principles of OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Encapsulation**\n",
        "   - Encapsulation means bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, known as a class.\n",
        "   - Access to the internal state of an object can be restricted using access modifiers like `private`, `protected`, or `public`.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     class Person:\n",
        "         def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
        "             self.__name = name  # Private attribute\n",
        "             self.__age = age\n",
        "\n",
        "         def get_name(self):\n",
        "             return self.__name\n",
        "         \n",
        "         def set_name(self, name):\n",
        "             self.__name = name\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Abstraction**\n",
        "   - Abstraction hides complex implementation details and shows only the necessary features of an object.\n",
        "   - It allows users to interact with objects at a high level without worrying about the underlying complexity.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
        "\n",
        "     class Animal(ABC):\n",
        "         @abstractmethod\n",
        "         def sound(self):\n",
        "             pass\n",
        "\n",
        "     class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "         def sound(self):\n",
        "             return \"Bark\"\n",
        "\n",
        "     class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "         def sound(self):\n",
        "             return \"Meow\"\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Inheritance**\n",
        "   - Inheritance allows a class (child class) to derive or inherit properties and behaviors from another class (parent class).\n",
        "   - It enables code reuse and hierarchical classification.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     class Vehicle:\n",
        "         def __init__(self, brand):\n",
        "             self.brand = brand\n",
        "\n",
        "         def drive(self):\n",
        "             return \"Driving...\"\n",
        "\n",
        "     class Car(Vehicle):\n",
        "         def __init__(self, brand, doors):\n",
        "             super().__init__(brand)\n",
        "             self.doors = doors\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Polymorphism**\n",
        "   - Polymorphism means \"many forms\" and allows methods in different classes to be called using the same name.\n",
        "   - It enables flexibility and extensibility in code.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     class Shape:\n",
        "         def area(self):\n",
        "             pass\n",
        "\n",
        "     class Rectangle(Shape):\n",
        "         def __init__(self, width, height):\n",
        "             self.width = width\n",
        "             self.height = height\n",
        "\n",
        "         def area(self):\n",
        "             return self.width * self.height\n",
        "\n",
        "     class Circle(Shape):\n",
        "         def __init__(self, radius):\n",
        "             self.radius = radius\n",
        "\n",
        "         def area(self):\n",
        "             return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Benefits of OOP:\n",
        "- Improved code readability and maintainability.\n",
        "- Easier to debug and test.\n",
        "- Promotes code reusability through inheritance.\n",
        "- Enhances software modularity and scalability.\n",

        "8:- **Encapsulation** in Python is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that restricts access to certain components of an object, ensuring that data is safe and can only be accessed or modified in controlled ways. Encapsulation is achieved through **access control** mechanisms and the use of **methods** to interact with an object's internal state.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Access Modifiers:**\n",
        "   Python uses naming conventions to define access levels:\n",
        "   - **Public Members:** Accessible from anywhere. By default, all attributes and methods are public.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     class Car:\n",
        "         def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
        "             self.make = make  # Public attribute\n",

        "     print(car.display_info())  # Accessible\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Protected Members:** Indicated by a single underscore (`_attribute`). This is a convention to indicate that the member is meant for internal use and should not be accessed directly.\n",

        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Private Members:** Indicated by a double underscore (`__attribute`). These are internally renamed to prevent accidental access or modification, effectively making them private.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     class Car:\n",

        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Getter and Setter Methods:**\n",
        "   Encapsulation promotes the use of **getter** and **setter** methods to control access to private attributes.\n",
        "   ```python\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Using Properties:**\n",
        "   Python provides the `@property` decorator as a more Pythonic way to implement encapsulation. It allows methods to be accessed like attributes while maintaining control over access and modification.\n",
        "   ```python\n",

        "       def __init__(self, make, model):\n",

        "\n",
        "   car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\")\n",
        "   print(car.make)  # Access as an attribute (getter)\n",
        "   car.make = \"Honda\"  # Modify as an attribute (setter)\n",
        "   print(car.make)  # Output: Honda\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Advantages of Encapsulation\n",
        "- **Data Security:** Protects the object's internal state from unwanted changes.\n",
        "- **Controlled Access:** Provides controlled ways to access or modify data.\n",

        "14:- **Polymorphism** is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types or classes). In simple terms, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, providing flexibility and making code more reusable and extensible.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Enhances Code Reusability**\n",
        "   - Polymorphism allows the same piece of code to work with different types of objects, reducing redundancy.\n",
        "   - For example, a single function or method can operate on objects of multiple types as long as they share a common interface or superclass.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Promotes Flexibility**\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Run-Time Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)**:\n",

        "2. **Reduced Complexity**: Simplifies code by abstracting specific implementations.\n",
        "3. **Scalability**: Makes it easier to scale applications by adding new behaviors or classes.\n",

        "16:- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several advantages that make it a preferred programming paradigm for many large, complex software systems. Some of the key benefits of OOP are:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Modularity**\n",
        "   - **Code Organization**: OOP allows you to divide the software into smaller, self-contained objects. Each object represents a specific entity and encapsulates both data and methods. This modular approach makes it easier to develop and maintain code.\n",
        "   - **Reuse**: Once a class is created, it can be reused across different programs or modules. This reduces redundancy and saves development time.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Encapsulation**\n",
        "   - **Data Hiding**: Encapsulation allows you to bundle the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. This keeps the internal workings of an object hidden from outside access and ensures that its state is modified only through well-defined methods (getters and setters).\n",
        "   - **Improved Security**: By restricting access to some of the object's components, you can prevent unintended interference and misuse. This helps protect the integrity of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Inheritance**\n",
        "   - **Code Reusability**: Inheritance allows a class (child or subclass) to inherit the properties and behaviors (methods) of another class (parent or superclass). This promotes code reuse and reduces duplication, making the system easier to maintain and extend.\n",
        "   - **Hierarchical Structure**: You can organize classes into hierarchical relationships, which is intuitive for modeling real-world entities. This structure helps organize complex systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Polymorphism**\n",
        "   - **Flexibility and Extensibility**: Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as instances of a common superclass. This enables you to use the same method name for different classes, with each class providing its own specific behavior.\n",
        "   - **Dynamic Method Resolution**: Polymorphism supports dynamic method invocation, making it possible to change the behavior of an object at runtime. This helps to extend functionality without modifying existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Maintainability and Modifiability**\n",
        "   - **Easier to Maintain**: OOP provides clear boundaries between different components (objects). Since the objects are modular and encapsulated, making changes to one part of the system (e.g., a method or class) doesn't significantly affect the other parts.\n",
        "   - **Simpler Modifications**: With inheritance, new features can be added by subclassing and extending the functionality of existing classes without modifying the original code. This makes OOP systems flexible and adaptable to future changes or requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **Abstraction**\n",
        "   - **Simplified Complex Systems**: Abstraction hides the complexity of the system by providing a simplified interface. Users or other systems interact with objects through their public interface, without needing to understand their internal workings.\n",
        "   - **Focus on Essentials**: By abstracting away the unnecessary details, OOP allows you to focus on the essential features of an object and its interaction with other objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. **Improved Collaboration**\n",
        "   - **Team Development**: OOP encourages team collaboration, as different team members can work on different classes or objects independently. Since the interfaces between objects are well-defined, multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without conflict.\n",
        "   - **Clearer Code Structure**: OOP's organizational principles (modularity, inheritance, etc.) help create a codebase that is easier to understand and follow, even for developers who are new to the project.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. **Real-World Modeling**\n",
        "   - **Natural Mapping to Real-World Entities**: OOP's use of objects, classes, and hierarchies makes it easier to model real-world scenarios. Entities in the real world (like a car, person, or bank account) can be represented as objects with properties and behaviors. This makes the code more intuitive and closer to the way humans think about the world.\n",
        "   - **Better Representation of Relationships**: Inheritance and polymorphism allow you to represent relationships like \"is-a\" (inheritance) and \"has-a\" (composition) more naturally.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9. **Better Code Organization and Structure**\n",
        "   - **Separation of Concerns**: In OOP, different concerns of a program (e.g., data management, user interface, logic) can be separated into different classes. This improves code organization and makes it easier to modify and extend specific parts of the system without affecting others.\n",
        "   - **Logical Grouping**: OOP allows logical grouping of related functionalities, making it easier to navigate and understand the system structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 10. **Scalability**\n",
        "   - **Easily Scalable Systems**: OOP facilitates building scalable systems by encouraging the use of classes and objects that can be easily extended. When new features or functionality are needed, they can be added by extending or modifying existing objects rather than rebuilding the system.\n",
        "   - **Object Collaboration**: OOP allows objects to interact with each other, enabling the creation of large and complex systems by combining small, reusable, and maintainable components.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Conclusion**\n",

These benefits make OOP well-suited for large, complex systems and help developers write cleaner, more organized, and scalable code.

        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Definition**\n",
        "- **Class Variable**:\n",
        "  - A **class variable** is a variable that is shared across all instances of the class. It is defined directly inside the class but outside of any methods.\n",
        "  - Class variables belong to the class itself rather than to any specific instance of the class.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Instance Variable**:\n",
        "  - An **instance variable** is a variable that is tied to a specific instance of the class. It is defined inside the `__init__` method and is prefixed with `self`, making it unique to each instance.\n",
        "  - Instance variables belong to an individual object (or instance) of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Scope**\n",
        "- **Class Variable**:\n",
        "  - Shared by all instances of the class. Changes made to the class variable affect all instances.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Instance Variable**:\n",
        "  - Unique to each instance of the class. Each object has its own copy of the instance variable.\n",

        "- **Class Variable**:\n",
        "  - Modifying a class variable through the class name will affect all instances of the class. However, modifying it through an instance (unless explicitly done) creates an instance variable of the same name, which shadows the class variable for that instance.\n",
        "\n",

        "3. **Access to Parent Class Methods and Attributes**:\n",

        "4. **Diamond Problem**:\n",
        "   - Multiple inheritance can lead to a situation known as the **diamond problem**. This occurs when a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common base class, potentially causing ambiguity. Python’s MRO handles this by following a linearization process.\n",

        "\n",
        "### **Disadvantages of Multiple Inheritance**:\n",
        "1. **Complexity**:\n",
        "   - Multiple inheritance can make the code more complex and harder to understand, especially when the inheritance tree is deep or involves many classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Diamond Problem**:\n",
        "   - If not properly handled (via MRO), it can lead to conflicts when multiple classes define the same method or attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Ambiguity**:\n",
        "   - In some cases, it might not be clear which method to call or which property to use if the method or property is defined in multiple base classes.\n",

        "Multiple inheritance is a powerful feature in Python that allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class, providing the ability to combine functionalities. While it offers advantages like flexibility and reusability, it also requires careful consideration of the class design, especially when dealing with potential conflicts like the diamond problem.

It is part of Python's object lifecycle management, specifically used for cleanup operations when an object is no longer in use.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Purpose of `__del__`**:\n",
        "The primary purpose of the `__del__` method is to provide a way to define any **cleanup** operations that should occur before the object is destroyed.

        "   - The `__del__` method is called automatically when an object is about to be garbage collected, i.e., when there are no more references to the object.\n",
        "   - It is important to note that the exact moment when the `__del__` method is called depends on the garbage collection process, which may not always happen immediately when an object goes out of scope.\n",

        "   - You typically use `__del__` for resource cleanup, such as closing files, releasing network sockets, or cleaning up other resources that the object may have acquired during its lifetime.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Automatic Garbage Collection**:\n",
        "   - Python has a garbage collector that automatically manages memory and deletes objects when they are no longer in use. The `__del__` method can be used to specify actions that should be taken just before the object is removed from memory.\n",
        "\n",

        "6. **Not Guaranteed to be Called**:\n",
        "   - While `__del__` is called during garbage collection, there is no guarantee when exactly the destructor will be invoked. This is because Python uses **reference counting** and a garbage collector that may not immediately collect an object.\n",

        "23:- Polymorphism in Python is one of the key principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This concept allows methods to behave differently based on the object they are acting upon. In the context of **inheritance**, polymorphism works by enabling **method overriding** in child classes, where the same method name can be used across different classes, but each class can implement it differently.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **How Polymorphism Works in Python with Inheritance:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Method Overriding**:\n",
        "   Polymorphism is achieved in Python when a child class overrides a method of its parent class. Even though the method has the same name in both the parent and child class, the behavior can be different depending on the class type.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Method Resolution**:\n",
        "   Python resolves method calls dynamically at runtime. This means that even if the method is called on an object of a parent class type, if the object is an instance of a subclass, the method defined in the subclass is invoked. This is known as **late binding**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Example of Polymorphism with Inheritance:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Animal:\n",

        "animal_sound(cat)  # Output: Cat meows\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Explanation of the Example**:\n",
        "1. **Parent Class (`Animal`)**: The `Animal` class has a method `speak` that simply returns a generic \"Animal makes a sound.\"\n",
        "2. **Child Classes (`Dog` and `Cat`)**: Both `Dog` and `Cat` inherit from the `Animal` class. They override the `speak` method to provide their own behavior: dogs bark and cats meow.\n",
        "3. **Function `animal_sound`**: This function accepts an `Animal` object (which can be an instance of any subclass of `Animal`). It calls the `speak` method on the passed object, but the method that gets executed depends on whether the object is an instance of `Dog` or `Cat`. This is an example of **polymorphism** — the same method (`speak`) behaves differently depending on the object it is acting upon.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Key Points**:\n",
        "1. **Same Method Name, Different Behavior**:\n",
        "   - The `speak` method is defined in both the parent (`Animal`) and the child classes (`Dog` and `Cat`), but it has different implementations.\n",
        "2. **Dynamically Resolved**:\n",
        "   - When you call `animal_sound(dog)`, Python dynamically calls the `speak` method of the `Dog` class, and when you call `animal_sound(cat)`, Python calls the `speak` method of the `Cat` class.\n",
        "3. **The Importance of Inheritance**:\n",
        "   - Polymorphism in Python with inheritance allows you to use the same method name for different classes but have each class implement its own behavior.\n",

        "### **Polymorphism with Inheritance in Practice**:\n",

        "\n",
        "### **Benefits of Polymorphism**:\n",
        "1. **Code Reusability**:\n",
        "   - You can write functions or methods that can work with objects of different types (all subclasses of a common superclass) without needing to know their exact types.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Flexibility**:\n",
        "   - Polymorphism makes your code more flexible and extensible. New subclasses can be added without modifying existing code (e.g., you can introduce new vehicle types in the example without changing the `make_move` function).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Maintainability**:\n",

        "### **Conclusion**:\n",
        "Polymorphism with inheritance in Python enables you to define methods in a parent class and override them in child classes, allowing the same method name to perform different actions based on the class of the object calling it. This facilitates cleaner, more flexible, and more reusable code by allowing you to treat different objects in a uniform way while still respecting their specific behaviors."

        "### **Explanation of the Example**:\n",
        "1. The `Person` class has three methods:\n",
        "   - `set_name`: Changes the name of the person and returns `self`.\n",
        "   - `set_age`: Changes the age of the person and returns `self`.\n",
        "   - `display`: Displays the name and age of the person and returns `self` to allow further chaining.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The method chaining happens in the following line:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   person.set_name(\"Alice\").set_age(25).display()\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   - First, `set_name(\"Alice\")` is called on the `person` object, which changes the name and returns the `person` object.\n",
        "   - Then, `set_age(25)` is called on the returned object, changing the age and returning the `person` object again.\n",
        "   - Finally, `display()` is called to print the updated values of `name` and `age`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Advantages of Method Chaining**:\n",
        "1. **Concise and Readable**:\n",
        "   - It allows multiple method calls to be written in a compact, fluid way, which can make the code more readable when it’s used appropriately.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Fluent Interface**:\n",
        "   - Method chaining helps create a \"fluent interface,\" where the methods flow together and resemble a natural language expression. This is commonly used in libraries for configuration, query-building, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Reduced Code Duplication**:\n",
        "   - It helps in reducing the need for repeating the object reference when calling multiple methods on the same object.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Considerations**:\n",
        "- **Clarity vs. Conciseness**:\n",
        "   - While method chaining can make code more concise, excessive chaining can reduce readability if overused. If methods become too long or complex, it might be better to break them up into separate lines for clarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Immutability**:\n",
        "   - Method chaining works best with mutable objects (where the object’s internal state can be modified). For immutable objects, you would need to return a new object each time a method is called (though this can still be done).\n",

        "Method chaining in Python OOP is a powerful technique that allows you to call multiple methods on the same object in a single line. It enhances code readability and conciseness by returning the object itself from each method, allowing subsequent method calls to be chained together. When used properly, it can make your code more fluid and expressive, especially in cases like configuration, query-building, or fluent APIs."

By implementing this method, you can make instances of your class callable.

        "\n",
        "2. **Simplifying Complex Operations**:\n",
        "   - If an object needs to perform complex operations or calculations, you can use `__call__` to encapsulate that logic in a callable object, simplifying its use.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Decorators**:\n",
        "   - `__call__` can also be useful in writing decorators. By making an object callable, you can treat it like a function that processes and returns another function.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Callable Configurations or Parameters**:\n",
        "   - You can use `__call__` to allow objects to act as dynamic configurations or callable parameters in functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Example of Using `__call__` for Dynamic Behavior**:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Multiply:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, factor):\n",
        "        self.factor = factor\n",
        "    \n",
        "    def __call__(self, value):\n",
        "        return self.factor * value\n",
        "\n",
        "# Create an instance of Multiply with a factor of 3\n",
        "multiply_by_three = Multiply(3)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Now call the object like a function\n",
        "result = multiply_by_three(5)  # This will multiply 5 by 3\n",
        "print(result)  # Output: 15\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Benefits of Using `__call__`**:\n",
        "- **Flexible Objects**: You can create objects that are flexible and behave like functions while still maintaining state and internal logic.\n",
        "- **Code Organization**: It helps in organizing code by encapsulating function-like behavior within a class, which is useful for complex systems where objects need to store both behavior and data.\n",
        "- **Custom Functionality**: `__call__` allows you to implement custom behavior for your objects when they are called, such as input validation, pre-processing, or caching.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Conclusion**:\n",
        "The `__call__` method in Python allows objects to be called like functions, enabling a wide range of use cases such as functors, decorators, and simplifying object behavior. By implementing `__call__`, you can give objects a function-like interface while still maintaining the benefits of encapsulating logic within a class."
